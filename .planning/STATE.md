# State: pi-gsd

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06)

**Core value:** Workflow files execute programmatically before the LLM ever sees them — zero shell round-trips, zero arbitrary command execution, fully typed from end to end.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — WXP Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (roadmap defined, ready to begin Phase 1)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan

## Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | WXP Foundation | WXP-01–14, INC-01–03, TST-01–03 (20 reqs) | ○ Pending |
| 2 | oclif Migration | CLI-01–06 (6 reqs) | ○ Pending |
| 3 | Type Cleanup | TYP-01–06 (6 reqs) | ○ Pending |
| 4 | Workflow Conversion | WFL-01–05 (5 reqs) | ○ Pending |
| 5 | Harness Distribution | HRN-01–07 (7 reqs) | ○ Pending |

## Accumulated Context

- Phase 4 (Workflow Conversion) depends on Phase 1 (WXP engine) and Phase 2 (oclif CLI) being complete before conversion begins
- Phase 3 (Type Cleanup) is sequenced after Phase 2 (user preference: sequential, not parallel)
- Phase 5 (Harness Distribution) is independent and can start after Phase 1 is complete
- Workflow backup strategy: commit `.bak` files to git for rollback trail
- `pi-gsd-settings.json` supports both global (`~/.gsd/`) and project-level (`.pi/gsd/`) scope; project overrides global
- Code-fence skipping in the WXP parser is foundational — must be implemented first within Phase 1
- Shell execution uses `execFileSync` (not `execSync`) — arguments as array, prevents shell injection
