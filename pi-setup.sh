    # "npm:@guwidoe/pi-prompt-suggester"
    # REMOVED: pi-prompt-suggester has two serious drawbacks that outweigh the benefit of inline suggestions:
    #   1. SLOW STARTUP - on every session start it runs an agentic codebase seeder (up to 16 Claude API
    #      calls via claude-sonnet-4.6) to rebuild its seed.json whenever key files change. This adds
    #      several seconds of latency before the input field is even usable.
    #   2. SILENT AUTO-SUBMIT - the suggester pre-fills the input with its predicted next user message
    #      (e.g. 'detect_project'). If you hit Enter before noticing, it submits without your consent
    #      and there is no way to interrupt it once the session has started.
